# Ladder Message Board

Just install relevant node packages and run npm start and you should be good to go!

- if you click on the Ladder logo in the Navbar it will take you back to the top
- React router is also implemented so you can add different components for different url paths easily!
- when you click create post a modal pops up similar to the actual ladder website
- timestamps are there too :)

For the database not all the timestamps were in the same format which was a little problematic. I'd also include more data like who made the post, the amount of engagement (likes and comments) in the post (would be useful when sorting by hot) etc. Maybe tag posts by category too so users can see posts they want to see.

I picked up firebase/firestore for the first time which was surprisingly simple. I learnt too use more react-bootstrap.

The challenge is already great! But maybe it's be interesting to add some more feautures to implement like sorting by hot or sorting posts by category.
